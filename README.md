# React Components Library

The following repo contains a few base common react components (and hooks) to be reused from project to project.
They aim to be:

- Simple (no fancy or superfluous features, only the strict minimum)
- Stylable (though basic default styles may be applid)
- (really) Semantic (appearance is only handled via CSS. 0 props with a visual appearance purpose).
- Rely on base HTML features as much as possible
- without external dependencies
- Mobile-first friendly
- Easily customizable
